Identification of number of participants :-
Part 1 :-
--> Dataset generation module was used to prepare the dataset.
--> GMMHMM with 3 hidden states and 1 gaussian mixture. Efficiency :- 90%

Part 2 :-
--> Dataset generation module was used to prepare the dataset.
--> GMMHMM with 3 hidden states and 1 gaussian mixture. Efficiency :- 100% for Arvind_9 file, 93.5% for Arnab, Ravish (83.8%)  
(yet to test for other files)

Part 3 :-
--> Dataset generation module was used to prepare the dataset.
--> The division of testing and training data was done by random selection, hence division of testing and training data was not optimal. 
Thus, the efiiciency was comparitively low. (30%)
